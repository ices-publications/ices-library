# Interacting with ICES library through the API
This is a place for guidance on how to create and manage entries, pull statistics and metadata out of the ICES library (on figshare platform).

Instructions are mostly kept on the wiki pages.

## Full figshare API documentation
This is available here: https://docs.figshare.com/

A help article on the API is here: https://help.figshare.com/article/how-to-use-the-figshare-api

For requests requiring authorisation at an institutional level

Some require admin-level authorisation or basic credentials (Stats service), and these are restricted to the Secretariat Publication team.

If you are an ICES community member and are interested in pulling information on of the library through the API or other means, get in touch.
